Push project on git:
Steps:
1) Go to github.com
2) Select green button "New".
3) Give repository name
	for example, "JDBC"
4) Click on "Create repository"
5) Copy clone link
6) Create an empty folder for local repository (CTRL+SHIFT+N)
7) Open cmd in that folder
8) Type following:
		=> git clone <paste_link_which_you_copied_in_5th_step>
   Press ENTER.
9) Now you have an folder created. (JDBC in our case)
10) in cmd, go to that folder...
		=> cd JDBC (in our case)

HINT : You can check that the folder is initialized with git OR not by enabling hidden items and check there must be a folder named ".git".

11) Now you can modify your changes.
	like, here I'm pasting JDBC project into JDBC folder which is named "TeluskoJDBC" where .git folder is visible.
12) Now in cmd, check for status...
		=> git status
	You'll find that the folder(TeluskoJDBC) you added will show in red colour.
13) Next command to add file in local repo is...
		=> git add .

	HINT : check for status(git status), everything will be shown in green colour.
14) commit them
		=> git commit -m "message you want to share with commit"
15) push all changes in remote repository.
		=> git push origin
